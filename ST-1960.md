| 3 | Where new man has gone before ||
| 4 | The Naked Time ||
| 5 | The Enemy Within ||
| 6 | Mudd's Women ||
| 7 | What are little girls made of? | 2 | They land on the planet where the nurse goes to see her fiance. Red shirts die. Fiancé turns out to be an android.
| 8 | Miri | 2 | Planet of children that age very slowly but there's a virus that kills them when they hit puberty. Really weird sexual chemistry between Kirk and Miri who by definition is a child
| 9 | Dagger of the Mind | 2 | After a prisoner escaped to the Enterprise we find out that he wasn’t a prisoner but a doctor that had been experimented on. Kirk goes down and has more pick with a crew member whilst Spock mind melds the doctor to find out the truth. Kirk wins because he just decides he is stronger than the brain jack machine. |
| 10 | The Corbomite Manoeuvre | 1 | They were flying through space and got blocked by a cube. Which they tried to go around and I just jumped back in their way. Then they blew it up only to find out that it was some kind of space buoy indicating that they weren’t meant to carry on. They were scanned by some advanced life form (Balok) who despite being able to see everything in the ship failed to acknowledge the clear misunderstanding. In typical Enterprise fashion various members ofstaff overreacted every step of the way. Kirk bluffed that he had some super device that would destroy anyone that attacked him and the “advanced” Balok folded. Never has the threat of death been quite so unexciting. Then after playing space tug-of-war Kirk wanted to play the good guy and save Balok only to find the whole thing was a test. |
| 11 | The Menagerie, Part I | 3 | It appears the past 10 episodes have been even rougher on Captain Pike than the viewer as he is in a bad way. We start with a clear attempt to make us think Spock is up to no good. He takes us back to Tallos causing him to be tried for court marshal with flashbacks to the pilot episode. Turns out the whole thing was a fiction shown to us by the Tallosians to keep Kirk busy to ensure Pike got to Tallos to live in his world of illusions. Best episode so far.
| 12 | The Menagerie, Part II |^|^
| 13 | The Conscience of the King | 2 | Kirk is pointed at a bad guy from his past however the bad guy has a beautiful daughter so gets entirely distracted and offered to take her and her acting crew to their next location. We find out Kirk is one of the only witnesses to be able to identify Kodos the Executioner after someone has been killing all the witnesses to his crimes. Que attempts at Kirk’s life that he narrowly avoids culminating in what must be one of the least surprising surprise twists when we find it was the daughter who had been killing them to spare her father.
